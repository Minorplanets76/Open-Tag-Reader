# Open-Tag-Reader
Animal EID tag reading

Respository for Open Source Tag Reader. Built in response to mandatory introduction of EID tags for sheep in NSW, Australia. Intent is to develop tag readers and associated software for easy DIY.

## Stick Reader
Simple stick reader to point at ear tag to read.  Ability to store tag numbers in a scanning session, and to compare to pre-set list (eg identify culls).

Stick reader consists of a RFID reader board and a user interface.

### RFID Reader Board
