## T-Display S3 AMOLED PLUS
This is another variant from [Lilygo](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-amoled-plus).

This variant includes integrated sd card slot and RTC, which solves having additional modules.  It also has a power management chip. it has a good enclosure which may simplify that aspect. A carrier board will still simplify wiring. 

Support for this board is via [Lilygo's Github Repository](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-AMOLED-Series).  Lewis Hu seems fairly responsive.  I have put together a [repository](https://github.com/Minorplanets76/Lilygo-T-Display-1.19-AMOLED-Minimal) for testing where I have cut out as much superfluous stuff as possible and was messing around with UI options. Ihave pages that cover PPM, SD Card and RTC.
