## T-Display S3 AMOLED
This board is from [Lilygo](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-amoled?variant=43271614267573}.  I have been testing the touch version. I highly recommend buying the version with pins soldered, or the touch version with the black shell.

Support for this board is via [Lilygo's Github Repository](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-AMOLED-Series).  Lewis Hu seems fairly responsive.  I have put together a [repository](https://github.com/Minorplanets76/Lilygo-T-Display-1.19-AMOLED-Minimal) for testing where I have cut out as much superfluous stuff as possible and was messing around with UI options.
