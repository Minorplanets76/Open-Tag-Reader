# Open-Tag-Reader Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The Open-Tag-Reader project is an ESP-based RFID ear tag scanning solution designed to track and manage livestock data. It provides a user-friendly web interface for adding, updating, and reviewing animal records.

## Goals
- Create a well-structured, easy-to-maintain codebase.
- Ensure seamless RFID tag reading and data management.
- Develop a responsive web-based UI optimized for mobile use.
- Enable efficient CSV-based data storage and retrieval.
- Facilitate easy deployment and updates.

## Milestones & Tasks

### **Phase 1: Repository Cleanup & Organization**
✅ Restructure file and folder layout for better navigation.
✅ Improve README with detailed project description and setup instructions.
✅ Add a `docs/` folder for detailed documentation.
✅ Define and document coding standards.

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality Development**
🔲 Implement reliable RFID tag scanning with ESP-based hardware.
🔲 Develop a data processing system to extract and store tag details.
🔲 Optimize CSV file handling for efficient data storage and retrieval.
🔲 Implement a simple API for data access and modification.

### **Phase 3: Web-Based UI Development**
🔲 Create a responsive web interface for viewing and managing scanned tags.
🔲 Implement automatic field population based on scanned RFID.
🔲 Allow manual updates and additional input (e.g., gender, comments, treatments).
🔲 Design an intuitive UI with large buttons and text for usability in field conditions.

### **Phase 4: Additional Features & Enhancements**
🔲 Implement session-based scanning to track multiple animals at once.
🔲 Enable batch updates for treatments and group assignments.
🔲 Integrate filtering and search options for easier data lookup.
🔲 Add support for multiple tag formats if required.

### **Phase 5: Testing & Optimization**
🔲 Conduct extensive hardware and software testing.
🔲 Optimize performance for low-latency data retrieval and updates.
🔲 Identify and fix bugs reported by users and testers.
🔲 Implement power-saving features to enhance battery life.

### **Phase 6: Deployment & Community Engagement**
🔲 Create detailed deployment and setup guides.
🔲 Prepare example use cases and tutorials.
🔲 Encourage community contributions via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
🔲 Release a stable version with clear versioning and changelogs.
