# Open-Tag-Reader Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The Open-Tag-Reader project is an ESP-based RFID ear tag scanning solution designed to track and manage livestock data. It provides a user-friendly web interface for adding, updating, and reviewing animal records.

## Goals
- Create a well-structured, easy-to-maintain codebase.
- Ensure seamless RFID tag reading and data management.
- Develop a responsive web-based UI optimized for mobile use.
- Enable efficient CSV-based data storage and retrieval.
- Facilitate easy deployment and updates.

## Milestones & Tasks

### **Phase 1: Repository Cleanup & Organization**
âœ… Dig up the project and restart it!

âœ… Restructure file and folder layout for better navigation.

ğŸ”² RFID information, carrier boards and code.

âœ… ESP module organised into folders.

ğŸ”² Define and document coding standards.

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality Development**
ğŸ”² Implement reliable RFID tag scanning with ESP-based hardware.
* Serial Comms
* Handling/decoding incoming messages
* Error checking, and duplicate scan handling
* Switching RFID reader on/off

ğŸ”² Develop a data processing system to extract and store tag details.
* tags.csv - contains tag data
* Tag Status - Unused, Active, Inactive
* bucket.csv - bucket file provided by manufacturer

ğŸ”² Develop CSV file handling to store scan records.
* animals.csv - animal associated with tag 
* Animal Status - Alive, Dead, Sold
* records.csv
* Groups - user definable - use to count and draft
* Traits
* Locations - PIC
* Transfers - NLIS transfers and sale data
* Vetinary Chemicals - Chemical register - LPA requirement
* Treatments - Product, WHP - LPA requirement
* Humans
* Dogs

ğŸ”² Time setting and timestamping of scan records.
* RTC integration
* Time setting manual
* Time setting NTP

ğŸ”² Basic UI
* Session Mnagement - New, continue
* Simple Count (unique tags in a seesion)
* Advanced Count - by group, type, etc
* Settings

ğŸ”² Scan feedback beeps and LED response.

### **Phase 3: Stick Reader Development**
ğŸ”² RFID coil and reader board development.

ğŸ”² ESP Board Enclosure.

ğŸ”² Battery holder and power switch.

ğŸ”² Implement power management for extended battery life.

ğŸ”² Ensure ruggedness and usability in field conditions.

ğŸ”² Test and refine the hardware and software integration.

### **Phase 4: Data Management**

ğŸ”² Store detailed information with each animal (e.g., breed, status, age, etc.).

ğŸ”² Allow assessment of animal traits within a session.

ğŸ”² Develop functionality to record treatments and transfers for each animal.

### **Phase 5: Web-Based UI Development**
ğŸ”² Create a responsive web interface for viewing and managing scanned tags.

ğŸ”² Implement automatic field population based on scanned RFID.

ğŸ”² Allow manual updates and additional input (e.g., gender, comments, treatments).

ğŸ”² Design an intuitive UI with large buttons and text for usability in field conditions.

### **Phase 6: Additional Features & Enhancements**
ğŸ”² Implement session-based scanning to track multiple animals at once.

ğŸ”² Enable batch updates for treatments and group assignments.

ğŸ”² Integrate filtering and search options for easier data lookup.

ğŸ”² Add support for multiple tag formats if required.

### **Phase 7: Testing & Optimization**
ğŸ”² Conduct extensive hardware and software testing.

ğŸ”² Optimize performance for low-latency data retrieval and updates.

ğŸ”² Identify and fix bugs reported by users and testers.

ğŸ”² Implement power-saving features to enhance battery life.

ğŸ”² Improve README with detailed project description and setup instructions.

### **Phase 8: Deployment & Community Engagement**
ğŸ”² Create detailed deployment and setup guides.

ğŸ”² Prepare example use cases and tutorials.

ğŸ”² Encourage community contributions via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

ğŸ”² Release a stable version with clear versioning and changelogs.
