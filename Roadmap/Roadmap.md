# Open-Tag-Reader Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The Open-Tag-Reader project is an ESP-based RFID ear tag scanning solution designed to track and manage livestock data. It provides a user-friendly web interface for adding, updating, and reviewing animal records.

## Goals
- Create a well-structured, easy-to-maintain codebase.
- Ensure seamless RFID tag reading and data management.
- Develop a responsive web-based UI optimized for mobile use.
- Enable efficient CSV-based data storage and retrieval.
- Facilitate easy deployment and updates.

## Milestones & Tasks

### **Phase 1: Repository Cleanup & Organization**
âœ… Dig up the project and restart it!

âœ… Restructure file and folder layout for better navigation.

ğŸ”² RFID information, carrier boards and code.

âœ… ESP module organised into folders.

âœ… Define and document coding standards.

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality Development**
ğŸ”² Implement reliable RFID tag scanning with ESP-based hardware.

ğŸ”² Develop a data processing system to extract and store tag details.

ğŸ”² Develop CSV file handling to store scan records.

ğŸ”² Time setting and timestamping of scan records.

ğŸ”² Scan feedback beeps and LED response.

### **Phase 3: Stick Reader Development**
ğŸ”² RFID coil and reader board development.

ğŸ”² ESP Board Enclosure.

ğŸ”² Battery holder and power switch.

ğŸ”² Scan checking - validity of scan checking for duplicate scans.

ğŸ”² Tag database - checking tag validity and currency.

ğŸ”² Basic session management (New, continue).

ğŸ”² Counting function (number of unique tags in a session).

ğŸ”² Implement power management for extended battery life.

ğŸ”² Ensure ruggedness and usability in field conditions.

ğŸ”² Test and refine the hardware and software integration.

### **Phase 4: Data Management**
ğŸ”² Define all the data to be recorded for each animal and their dependencies.

ğŸ”² Implement functionality to associate a tag with an animal.

ğŸ”² Store detailed information with each animal (e.g., breed, status, age, etc.).

ğŸ”² Allow assessment of animal traits within a session.

ğŸ”² Develop functionality to record treatments and transfers for each animal.

### **Phase 5: Web-Based UI Development**
ğŸ”² Create a responsive web interface for viewing and managing scanned tags.

ğŸ”² Implement automatic field population based on scanned RFID.

ğŸ”² Allow manual updates and additional input (e.g., gender, comments, treatments).

ğŸ”² Design an intuitive UI with large buttons and text for usability in field conditions.

### **Phase 6: Additional Features & Enhancements**
ğŸ”² Implement session-based scanning to track multiple animals at once.

ğŸ”² Enable batch updates for treatments and group assignments.

ğŸ”² Integrate filtering and search options for easier data lookup.

ğŸ”² Add support for multiple tag formats if required.

### **Phase 7: Testing & Optimization**
ğŸ”² Conduct extensive hardware and software testing.

ğŸ”² Optimize performance for low-latency data retrieval and updates.

ğŸ”² Identify and fix bugs reported by users and testers.

ğŸ”² Implement power-saving features to enhance battery life.

ğŸ”² Improve README with detailed project description and setup instructions.

### **Phase 8: Deployment & Community Engagement**
ğŸ”² Create detailed deployment and setup guides.

ğŸ”² Prepare example use cases and tutorials.

ğŸ”² Encourage community contributions via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

ğŸ”² Release a stable version with clear versioning and changelogs.
