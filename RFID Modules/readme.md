### Overview 
I have tested two RFID boards capable of reading HDX tags. 


I have given a little bit of consideration to developing my own board, but that seems like an unnecessary distraction. 

### Tuning
RF stuff is a bit of a mystery to me. I have included trim capacitors. At some stage I will do some range testing or try and learn about optimising the antenna.
