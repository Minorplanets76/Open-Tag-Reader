# WL134A RFID Module

## Overview
I found this module on Aliexpress.  It comes with a 70mm and 150mm coil and a capicitor to suit.  I have made a simple carrier board that includes a mini boost supply, a trimmer capacitor, and a couple of voltage dividers for compatability with the 3.3V Esp32.  I has a slighty more challenging interface.  It's smaller and a bit cheaper.
