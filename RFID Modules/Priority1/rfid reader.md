This is an Australian product from  [Priority 1 Design](https://www.priority1design.com.au/) who have designed a number of RFID reading boards including a number for reading [Animal Tags](https://www.priority1design.com.au/rfid_reader_modules.html#animal_tag_reader_writer).  The board used is the [FDX-B/HDX RFID Reader Writer with TTL serial port](https://www.priority1design.com.au/shopfront/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=10) as this reads the HDX format required and is simple to interface to another microcontroller operating the User Interface.  The board has the option to use different antennas, which will affect range, but comes with a 49mm coil that is is easy to implement.  It simply blurts out the Country Code and Tag ID in ASCII format over serial interface.  It also has the ability to receive commands via serial.
